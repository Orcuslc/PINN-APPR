# PINN-APPR
A faster and more efficient physics-informed neural network (PINN) using first order approximation.

The original PINN comes from Raissi et al. at https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs .

- **sin-pde-loss**: gives an example of PINN's failure when the training time is not sufficiently long.
- **sin-integration-mse**: gives an example of the improved PINN using first-order approximation.
